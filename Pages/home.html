                    <p>I'm Kofi Barton-Byfield, a former professional rugby player from Bath, UK, with a deep passion for data science and analytics. After completing a professional stint with Bath Rugby and Exeter Chiefs, I have shifted my focus towards building a successful career in data science.</p>

                    <p>    I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of Exeter, where I graduated with Upper Second-Class Honours (2:1), and I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Applied Social Data Science at Trinity College, Dublin. My academic background has equipped me with strong analytical skills and proficiency in a variety of programming languages and tools such as Python, R and MATLAB.</p>
                        
                    <p>   Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to connect with me!</p>
