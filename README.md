I began this project to teach myself the basics of HTML and CSS, however during the process I have obtained not only those skills but an interactive website to showcase my portfolio of data science projects (and a stronger grasp on Java scripts)


This project was completed using Virtual Code Studio, and is hosted using the free inbuilt website platform GitHub Pages.

Comments and  advice are always welcome! Just click the suggestions page at the bottom of every page in the footer.
