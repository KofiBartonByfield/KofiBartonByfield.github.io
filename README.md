# Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. The site showcases my projects, professional experience and a blog where I share insights, tutorials, and things I’m learning in data science, analytics and related fields.

The website is fully static and designed to be responsive, with a consistent header and navigation across all pages. A sidebar provides quick access to my contact information, and the main content dynamically updates to highlight my latest work. Blog posts are loaded directly from a folder of text files, allowing new entries to appear automatically without updating the code.

This portfolio demonstrates my skills in web development, data visualisation, and interactive design, while providing a platform to share my ongoing learning and projects.
