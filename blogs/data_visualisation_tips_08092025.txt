# Data Visualisation Tips I Learned Today

08/09/2025

Today I spent some time improving my data visualisation skills. Here are a few things I picked up:

1. Less is more — avoid clutter and focus on the key message.
2. Use consistent colour schemes for better readability.
3. Always label your axes clearly, even if you think it’s obvious.
4. Interactive plots can make a huge difference when presenting complex datasets.

Next, I’m planning to experiment with D3.js to make dynamic visualisations. I’ll post my progress soon.
